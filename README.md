# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:


The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities(Urban,Suburban and Rural) in which Pyber operates. Creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved cities.

## Results:

### Total fares,total drivers and average fares:

From the below pyber summary we can see that there are several key findings:

![Pyber_summary.png](https://github.com/klkanchi/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_summary.png)

- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
- Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
- Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
- The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.

### Pyber fare summary by City type:

- As shown in the multiple line graph above, the urban cities had the highest total fare within the months of January to April 2019 followed by the rural cities while the urban cities had the lowest fare and the low fares can be attributed to the empty cells observed in the rural cities column after arranging the data into the specified date range using the loc function. 

- In summary, the drop in the number of ride usage in the rural cities within the months of January to April, 2019 could be due to the low number of available rides and drivers in those cities and allocating more rides & drivers to the rural cities will most likely reduce average fare per ride & driver which will invariably boost ride affordability. 

- In addition, although the available data is limited to 2019, the Urban cities might also benefit from more ride allocation within the months of January to April as this will help meet the demands for rides in those months , increase revenue and enhance affordability.


## Summary:

- Based on the analysis my business recommendations to Pyber are: Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. 
- Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.
- This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business
